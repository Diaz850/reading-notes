What is an expression in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, an expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a simple value, a variable, an operation that combines values, or a combination of these elements. Expressions can be as short as a single constant value or as complex as a series of operations involving variables, functions, and more.

Why would we use a loop in our code?
Repetition: Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you can use a loop to perform a task multiple times. This is especially useful for tasks like iterating through a list of items, processing data, or performing calculations.

Iterating Through Data Structures: Loops are commonly used to traverse and manipulate elements in data structures such as arrays, lists, dictionaries, and more. You can access each element in the structure one at a time, which is essential for working with collections of data.

Automation: Loops can automate tasks that require repeated actions. For example, you can use a loop to automate file processing, sending emails to a list of recipients, or updating multiple records in a database.

Conditional Execution: Loops can be used to conditionally execute a block of code. You can use constructs like while loops to continue executing code as long as a certain condition is true, or for loops to iterate a fixed number of times.

Reducing Code Redundancy: Loops help in reducing code redundancy. Instead of writing the same code for each element in a collection, you can use a loop to perform the same operation for each element, making your code more concise and maintainable.

Dynamic Processing: Loops provide a way to handle variable amounts of data. You can use loops to process data that may change in size, which is common in applications where data is user-generated or dynamically obtained from external sources.

Efficiency: Using loops can lead to more efficient code. By iterating through data or performing repetitive tasks with loops, you can optimize your code's performance.

When does a for loop stop executing?
A for loop stops executing when a specified condition is no longer true. In most programming languages, a for loop is used to iterate a specific number of times or over a specific range of values. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition specified in the loop header remains true, and it stops as soon as the condition becomes false.

How many times will a while loop execute?
The number of times a while loop will execute depends on the condition specified in the loop. In a while loop, the loop continues to execute as long as the condition within the parentheses is true.
