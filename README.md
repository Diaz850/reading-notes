# My Code Fellow Reading Notes 
>A failure is not always a mistake. It may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.

*B.F. Skinner*

## Growth Mindset 
Growth mindset to me means to be presistent in obtaining an objective despite there being difficulty or uncertainty in the outcome.

1.Remember that nothing is Impossible. 

2.Practice makes Perfect. 

3.Dedication and Discipline create a desired outcome.
