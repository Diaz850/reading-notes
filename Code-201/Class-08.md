## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox is like lining up toys or blocks in a single line, where you can easily control how much space each toy or block takes and make them fit nicely in a row or column.
## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis is like the road where cars (items) move, and the cross axis is like the sidewalk where they stop when they need to.
## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Using certain properties of flexbox can negatively impact accessibility because it might affect the order in which content is read by screen readers or how it appears to people with disabilities. 
For example, changing the order of items visually with flexbox could make the content confusing for screen reader users, and not setting the right properties might lead to poor color contrast, making it hard for people with visual impairments to read the content. So, while flexbox is great for layout, it needs to be used carefully to ensure everyone can access and understand the content on a website.
