Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
When a web page loads, the browser first parses the HTML file, creating the Document Object Model (DOM) to represent the page's structure.

Once these are encountered, the browser fetches and parses CSS files, creating the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) to define styles for the page's elements. As the browser continues parsing HTML, it may pause when encountering script tags, loading and executing JavaScript files.
